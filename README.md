# APARC Training School on “Climate Data Science and Artificial Intelligence in the Global South”.

# Time-period: 
29 th - 31 th October 2023.
# Venue: 
University of Rwanda - College of Science and Technology, Kigali (GoogleMap)
# Funding: 
SPARC – Stratosphere-troposphere Processes And their Role in Climate.
# Highlights: 
Learning of methods to co-design actionable knowledge for climate resilience and how to best establish a training program on AI and Climate Change for ECSs.

# Scope: 
The training school will focus on new methods of Data Analysis and AI to inspire innovation and improve weather and climate services and user-relevant information on the sub-seasonal-decadal scale in the Global South. For future plans, time will be devoted to discussing plans for a SPARC training school on AI and Climate Change in the Global South with strong involvement of local universities.

# Goals:
The aim is to bring together global scientists, observational and modeling groups to provide a platform for discussion on how to jointly design knowledge and best train ECSs on the latest advances in Data Science and AI for weather and climate research, to inspire innovative solutions to mitigate climate impact and risk.

# Format: 
The training school will include morning lectures and afternoon computer exercises on Python Data Analysis and AI tools for climate and weather research.

# Participants: 
The training school is open to BSc, MSc and PhD students, as well as postdoctoral fellows from all over the world who are attending the WCRP OSC in Kigali, as well as local students and researchers. Participation may be limited (30 places), and ECS from the Global South are particularly encouraged.

# Financial support: 
Participation in the training school is free of charge. Coffee breaks, lunches and accommodation are also included, as well as a social evening. Financial assistance will be available for those who need to cover the cost of flight changes for at least a limited number of ECSs, except WMO-funded flights.
