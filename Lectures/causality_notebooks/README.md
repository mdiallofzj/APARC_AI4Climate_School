# Causal Analysis for Climate Science

The purpose of this repository is to provide example Python notebooks showing Causal Analysis methods
applied to the climate science domain.

They are a modified version of the Supplementary material for the paper by Kretschmer et al. (2021), 'Quantifying Teleconnection pathways using Causal Networks' available at https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/bams/102/12/BAMS-D-20-0117.1.xml?tab_body=pdf


The original Supplementary material code for the paper can be found at https://github.com/informatics-lab/causality/tree/master/causality_paper 

The environment.yml file details all the Python packages necessary to run the notebooks in this repository.
